Project 6: Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST
Overview: Built a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Objective: To develop a robust image classification model capable of recognizing digits from grayscale 28x28 pixel images.

Dataset:

MNIST — 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image representing a digit.

Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Steps & Highlights:

Data Preprocessing: Normalized pixel values, reshaped inputs, and performed one-hot encoding on the target labels.

Model Architecture:

Used CNN layers (Conv2D, MaxPooling2D) followed by Dropout and Dense layers.

Added ReLU activations and softmax in the final layer for multiclass classification.

Training: Trained the model with categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.

Evaluation: Achieved over 98% accuracy on the test dataset.

Visualization: Plotted confusion matrix and visualized correct and incorrect predictions.

Model Deployment (Optional): Saved the trained model using .h5 format for deployment.

Outcome: Successfully built an accurate digit recognition model with real-time inference capabilities — ideal for OCR applications, educational tools, and embedded devices.
