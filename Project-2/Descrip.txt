Project 2: Store Sales Forecasting (Time Series with XGBoost)
Overview: Built a time series forecasting model for predicting item sales using XGBoost.

Dataset: Kaggle’s “Store Item Demand Forecasting Challenge”

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, XGBoost, Matplotlib

Feature Engineering:

Added lag features, difference features, and rolling statistics (mean, std).

Considered time trends, seasonality, and store-item interactions.

Modeling:

Trained an XGBoost regressor on preprocessed data without additional test-train splits (already provided).

Tuned hyperparameters and predicted future demand for unseen data.

Outcome: Learned how boosting methods handle time series, gained deep insights into time-based feature engineering.
