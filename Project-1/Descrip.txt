Project 1: Loan Prediction Analysis
Overview: Developed a binary classification model to predict loan approvals using a real-world financial dataset.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Steps:

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing including one-hot encoding and feature scaling.

Engineered new features like EMI from raw loan data.

Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.

Used ROC-AUC and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

Outcome: Achieved reliable predictions and learned valuable lessons on handling imbalanced classification problems.
