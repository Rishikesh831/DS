Absenteeism Analysis & Prediction Dashboard
Overview: Analyzed employee absenteeism patterns using HR and health-related data to identify key factors influencing absence behavior.

Objective: To support HR decisions by uncovering trends and creating a predictive, interactive dashboard to monitor employee attendance risk.

Tech Stack: Python (for data preprocessing and modeling), Power BI (for dashboard deployment), scikit-learn, Pandas

Key Highlights:

Cleaned and transformed raw absenteeism data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Created new features like absenteeism categories (low/medium/high) and absenteeism score.

Trained a classification model to predict absenteeism risk using logistic regression.

Deployed a Power BI dashboard with:

Absenteeism risk segmentation

Filters by department, reason, and age

Visual insights on monthly and weekly trends

Predictive output integrated as a column for decision support

Outcome: Enabled real-time, interactive absenteeism tracking for HR teams through Power BI, enhancing visibility into behavioral patterns and employee wellness.
