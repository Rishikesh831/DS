 Project 5: Property Classification Model
Overview: Built a classification model to categorize real estate properties based on features like area, location, and amenities.

Objective: To assist real estate stakeholders in automatically classifying properties into predefined categories (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial) using structured data.

Dataset: Included fields such as property size, location, price, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, furnishing status, and more.

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Steps & Highlights:

Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and converting categorical features using one-hot encoding.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and feature importance.

Engineered features like price per square foot and property density.

Applied and compared multiple classification models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost Classifier

Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores.

Final model achieved high classification accuracy and was saved for future deployment or integration.

Outcome: Developed a robust classification pipeline capable of accurately predicting property categories based on descriptive features â€” beneficial for real estate listings, property valuation tools, and market segmentation.
